# Project-Badger

Project Badger [Working Title] is a tactical first person stealth action game where the player must explore, scavenge and most importantly, survive. Oh and you play as a badger assassin, thatâ€™s pretty neat. 

Working to take down a rival syndicate, FANG, you must covertly traverse behind enemy lines. While there will always be an objective at hand, the routes you choose to take in order to accomplish them are yours. 

The player will be able to retrofit themselves with new and enhanced gear as they progress, allowing for new ways to approach the same situation depending on your playstyle. 

The environment is just another tool at the player's disposal. The world can be tampered with to gain advantages over your enemies; traverse through vents, cut fuze boxes to kill the lights, set off alarms, disable security systems, throw objects to alert guards, etc. 

Although stealth is the name of the game, sometimes you're going to have to go loud. Players will have plenty of viable combat options, and should be encouraged to make use of them when the time is right, but too much noise will draw a lot of unwanted attention, you better have a clean way out.
